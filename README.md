# Lospec Palette Scrape

## Elm

This Elm package contains definitions and convienence functions for all palettes on the [Lospec Palette List](https://lospec.com/palette-list).

None of these palettes are created by me - please use responsibly and attribute the original creators wherever possible.

## Scraper

This repo also contains a Python script I wrote in order to scrape the latest palette list. For usage information:

```bash
python ./bin/scraper.py -h
```

The _scraped_palettes.json_ file in this repository is periodically updated with the latest colour palettes.
